# CAPSULE CAT - Puzzle Platformer Game
The Capsule Cat by Cyberhippie

You are the commemorative 100th pet sent into space for test purposes. You’ve been locked in a capsule ever since the shuttle with the scientist crew arrived at the station. Now they seem to be in trouble! Use your cat wits and 9 lives to survive the trip back to the surface of the Earth. Eyes of the world are on you. 

- old TV effects (pause, play, rewind, forward, the analog tape creates a distortion effect where the cat is doubled so you can use two different thing s at once - one red, the other one fading white/blue)

Collect dog tags.

You escaped a launch (?)

On October 18, 1963, France launched Félicette the cat aboard Veronique AGI sounding rocket No. 47. The launch was directed by the French Centre d'Enseignement et de Recherches de Médecine Aéronautique (CERMA). Félicette was recovered alive after a 15 minute flight and a decent by parachute. Félicette had electrodes implanted into her brain, and the recorded neural impulses were transmitted back to Earth. Originally Felix the cat had been chosen to undertake this mission, but escaped before the launch. A second cat was sent to space by CERMA on October 24, 1963. There was a delay in recovery of the capsule, and this cat was found dead when finally recovered.[13][14]

The final French animal launches were of two monkeys in March 1967.
